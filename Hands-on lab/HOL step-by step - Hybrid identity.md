# Hybrid identity hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab you will setup and configure a number of different hybrid identity scenarios. The scenarios involve an Active Directory single-domain forest named contoso.local, which in this lab environment, consists (for simplicity reasons) of a single domain controller named DC1 and a single domain member server named APP1. The intention is to explore Azure AD-related capabilities that allow you to integrate Active Directory with Azure Active Directory, optimize hybrid authentication and authorization, and provide secure access to on-premises resources from Internet for both organizational users and users who are members of partner organizations. 

## Overview

Contoso has asked you to integrate their on-premises Active Directory single-domain forest named contoso.local with Azure AD and implement all necessary prerequisites to allow them to benefit from such Azure AD features as single sign-on to cloud and on-premises applications, enhanced sign-in security with Multi-Factor Authentication and Windows Hello for Business, Hybrid Azure AD join, Self-Service Password Reset and Password Protection, automatic enrollment of Windows 10 devices into Microsoft Intune, and Azure AD Privileged Identity Protection. They want to also provide secure access to their on-premises, Windows Integrated Authentication-based applications from Internet for both organizational users and users who are members of partner organizations, although they also want to be able to loosen restrictions when access originates from Hybrid Azure AD joined computers residing in their on-premises data centers. The same applications need to also be made available to Contoso's business partners. 

## Solution architecture

From the architectural standpoint, the deployment will consist of the following components:

-   On-premises Active Directory environment consisting of a single domain controller (DC1) and one domain member server (APP1), running Windows Server 2016 operating system. 

-   Contoso Azure AD tenant

-   Fabrikam Azure AD tenant

    ![High level architecture consisting of the on-premises environment represented by a rectangle on the left-hand side, two cloud outlines representing the Azure AD tenant of Contoso and Fabrikam on the right-hand side, and the Microsoft Intune icon in the middle. The on-premises environment contains an icon representing Active Directory domain controllers, providing such functionality as Azure AD Connect-based synchronization with attribute level filtering and password writeback, Azure AD Application Proxy with its on-premises connector, Service Connection Point for Hybrid Azure AD join, and Password Protection DC Agent. There is also a web server icon, representing the hybrid Azure AD joined server hosting the APP1 application, used also as the Password Application Proxy. The Contoso Azure AD tenant provides such functionality as Azure AD application proxy, My Apps portal, Automatic Intune enrollment, Enterprise State Roaming, Conditional Access, Azure AD Identity Protection, Azure AD Privileged Identity Management, Azure AD MFA, and Self-Service Password Reset.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-HybridIdentityImages/media/HOL_Architecture_Overview.png)

### Summary

In this exercise, you integrated an Active Directory forest with an Azure Active Directory tenant by creating an Azure Active Directory tenant and activating an Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 trial, creating and configuring an Azure AD user, purchasing a custom domain name, assigning a custom domain name to the Contoso Azure AD tenant, configuring DNS suffix in the Contoso Active Directory forest, installing Azure AD Connect, enable Active Directory Recycle Bin, configuring Azure AD Connect attribute-level filtering, initiating and verifying directory synchronization, configuring Hybrid Azure AD join, and performing Hybrid Azure AD join of a Windows Server 2016 VM.


## Exercise 2: Manage Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control in Hybrid Scenarios

Duration: 150 minutes

### Overview

In this exercise, you will optimize authentication, authorization, and access control for Contoso Active Directory environment integrated with the Contoso Azure AD tenant by enabling Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, enabling Azure AD password writeback and Self-Service Password Reset, implementing, Azure AD Password Protection, enabling Azure Active Directory Identity Protection, enabling Automatic Intune Enrollment, as well as implementing Azure AD Privileged Identity Management and Azure AD Conditional Access Policies.


### Task 1: Create Active Directory groups

In this task, you will create and configure Active Directory groups that will be used to control authentication, authorization, and access control and synchronize them to the Contoso Azure AD tenant. 

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **DC1**, from the **Server Manager** window, under **Tools** start the **Active Directory Users and Computers** console. 

2. In the **Active Directory Users and Computers** console, expand the **contoso.local** node and navigate to the **Demo Accounts > Groups**. 

    ![Navigate to Demo Accounts > Groups](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-HybridIdentityImages/media/NodeNavigation.png "DemoAccounts > Groups")

3. In the **Groups** directory, right-click then select **New** then select **Group**. Create a new group with the following settings and select **OK**:

    - Group name: **Engineering - Mandatory MFA**

    - Group name (pre-Windows 2000): **Engineering - Mandatory MFA**

    - Group scope: **Global**

    - Group type: **Security**

    ![Create a new group.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-HybridIdentityImages/media/CreateGroup.png "Create new group")

4. Open the **Properties** window of the **Engineering - Mandatory MFA** group, in the **Description** text box, type **Engineering users with user state-based MFA enforcement (without Conditional Access)** then select **Apply** then **OK**.

5. Within the Remote Desktop session to **DC1**, from the Script pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following to add designated users to the newly created group (replace the placeholder `<custom_domain_name>` with the actual name of the custom verified domain name you assigned to the Contoso Azure AD tenant).

    ```pwsh
    $domainName = '<custom_domain_name>'
    $users = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity 'Engineering' -Recursive | Where-Object {($_.objectClass -eq 'user') -and ($_.distinguishedName -like "*OU=NY,OU=US,OU=Users,OU=Demo Accounts,DC=contoso,DC=local")}
    foreach ($user in $users) {
        $user = Get-ADUser -Identity $User.SamAccountName
        Add-ADGroupMember -Identity 'Engineering - Mandatory MFA' -Members $user
    }
    ```

6. From the console pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, start Azure AD Connect delta synchronization by running the following:

   ```pwsh
   Import-Module -Name 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin\ADSync\ADSync.psd1'
   
   Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
   ```

7. In the Remote Desktop session to **DC1**, in the Internet Explorer window displaying the Azure portal, navigate to the **Contoso - Overview** blade of the Contoso Azure AD tenant and select **Groups** on the left.

8. On the **Groups - All groups** blade, verify that there is an entry representing the **Engineering - Mandatory MFA** group containing the Azure AD user accounts matching Active Directory user accounts which are members of the Active Directory **Engineering - Mandatory MFA** group.


### Task 2: Assign EMS E5 licenses to Azure AD users

In this task, you assign a value to the **UsageLocation** attribute of each user account and assign an Azure AD Premium license to each user. This is necessary in order to implement Azure AD-based Multi-Factor Authentication for these users.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **DC1**, from the Script pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following to install Azure AD Graph PowerShell module for Graph (select **Yes to All** when prompted whether to proceed with the installation):

    ```pwsh
    Install-Module AzureAD
    ```

2. From the Script pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following to sign in to the Contoso Azure AD tenant. When prompted, sign in with the **john.doe** Azure AD user account, which you created in the previous exercise.

    ```pwsh
    Connect-AzureAD
    ```

3. From the Script pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following to set the **Location** attribute to **United States** for all Azure AD user accounts with the UPN suffix matching the custom verified domain name of the Contoso Azure AD tenant. 

    ```pwsh
    $domainName = (Get-AzureADDomain | Where-Object IsDefault -eq 'True').Name
    Get-AzureADUser | Where-Object {$_.UserPrincipalName -like "*@$domainName"} | Set-AzureADUser -UsageLocation 'US'
    ```
4. From the Script pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following to assign the EM+S E5 trial licenses to all Azure AD user accounts with the UPN suffix matching the custom verified domain name of the Contoso Azure AD tenant. 

    ```pwsh
    $license = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.AssignedLicense
    $license.SkuId = (Get-AzureADSubscribedSku | Where-Object {$_.SkuPartNumber -eq 'EMSPREMIUM'}).SkuId
    $licensesToAssign = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.AssignedLicenses
    $licensesToAssign.AddLicenses = $license
    $users = Get-AzureADUser | Where-Object {$_.UserPrincipalName -like "*@$domainName"}
    foreach($user in $users) { 
        Set-AzureADUserLicense -ObjectId $user.ObjectId -AssignedLicenses $licensesToAssign
    }
    ```

### Task 3: Enable Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication

In this task, you will configure user state-based Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication for members of the **Engineering - Mandatory MFA** group.

   > **Note**: In general, enabling Azure Multi-Factor Authentication using Conditional Access policies is the recommended approach, since it offers more flexibility. Setting Multi-Factor Authentication by modifying the user state requires users to perform two-step verification every time they sign in and overrides Conditional Access policies. On the other hand, this approach might be required if existing licensing arrangement does not include Conditional Access.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **DC1**, from the Script pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following to install Azure AD MSOnline PowerShell module for Graph (select **Yes to All** when prompted whether to proceed with the installation):

    ```pwsh
    Install-Module MSOnline
    ```

2. From the Script pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following to sign in to the Contoso Azure AD tenant. When prompted, sign in with the **john.doe** Azure AD user account, which you created in the previous exercise.

    ```pwsh
    Connect-MsolService
    ```

3. From the Script pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following to enable Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication for all Azure AD user accounts with the UPN suffix matching the custom verified domain name of the Contoso Azure AD tenant. 

    ```pwsh
    $objectIdGUID = (Get-MsolGroup | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq 'Engineering - Mandatory MFA'}).objectId.Guid
    $users = Get-MsolGroupMember -GroupObjectId $objectIdGUID
    $st = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Online.Administration.StrongAuthenticationRequirement
    $st.RelyingParty = "*"
    $st.State = "Enabled"
    $sta = @($st)
    foreach($user in $users) { 
        Set-MsolUser -ObjectId $user.ObjectId -StrongAuthenticationRequirements $sta
    }
    ```

4. To verify the outcome, within the Remote Desktop session to **DC1**, in the Internet Explorer window displaying the Azure portal, navigate to the **Users - All users** blade of the Contoso Azure AD tenant and select **Multi-Factor Authentication** (you might need to select **...** first).

### Task 8: Test an Azure AD Application Proxy application

1. From the lab computer, start a browser in Private mode and browse to <https://myapps.microsoft.com>.

2. When prompted, sign in by using the **jane.doe** Fabrikam Azure AD user account. 

3. Once signed in, select the **Jane Fabrikam** icon in the upper right corner of the Application Access Panel page and, in the drop-down menu, select **Contoso**.

4. On the **Apps** page of the **Application Access Panel**, select the **APP1 Default Web Site** icon. This will automatically open a new browser tab displaying the Default Web Site page on APP1.


### Summary

In this exercise, you configured access to on-premises Integrated Windows Authentication app (implemented as the default IIS web site) from the internet by installing and configuring Azure AD Application Proxy. You also tested access to this application by using a Contoso Azure AD tenant user account as well as by using a Fabrikam Azure AD tenant user account configured as a guest account in the Contoso Azure AD tenant. 

## Lab summary

In this hands-on lab, you setup and configured a number of different hybrid identity scenarios. The scenarios involved an Active Directory single-domain forest named contoso.local, which in this lab environment, consisted (for simplicity reasons) of a single domain controller named DC1 and a single domain member server named APP1. You explored Azure AD-related capabilities that allowed you to integrate Active Directory with Azure Active Directory, optimized hybrid authentication and authorization, and provided secure access to on-premises resources from Internet for both organizational users and users who are members of partner organizations. 

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 20 Minutes

### Task 1: Delete resources

1. Now that the HOL is complete, go ahead and delete all of the Resource Groups created for this HOL. You will no longer need those resources, and it will be beneficial to clean up your Azure Subscription. In addition, remove the verified domain from the Contoso Azure AD tenant.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
